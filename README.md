### Hello! These are some projects I have been working on. There is a short description of each project below, with a longer description of each project in the README.md of each of their specific folders.

**basicLanguage:** Implements an interpreter for a limited version of the programming language BASIC

**birthdayProblem:** Implements a self-written hashtable and uses it to test the birthday paradox: it only takes an average of 23 people until you have a greater than 50% chance to pick two people with the same birthday. 

**companyMerger:** Keeps track of different companies, allowing the user to merge companies (creating a new, mega company) and split companies (returning all the companies in this mega company to their state right before the previous merge)

**doubletGame:** Implements a self-written MinHeap, uses this MinHeap to play Lewis Carl's Doublet game. 

**examSchedules:** Implements a self-written Binary Search Tree and AVL tree, uses these trees to keep track of classes in examScheduler, which takes the schedules of multiple different students and yields an exam schedule where no student will have two exams at the same time

**scheduleBuilder:** Takes all possible timeslots of the classes the user wants to take and outputs all possible schedule combinations, ensuring that 1) there are no conflicts between classes and 2) Any lectures that are paired to specific discussions are still paired

**secretMessages:** 
Uses rsa encryption and decryption to pass secret messages through files

**wordPermutations:** Takes a word and uses recursion to output all possible arrangements of the letters within that word
